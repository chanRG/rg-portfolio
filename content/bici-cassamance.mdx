There are journeys that test your endurance and others that fill your soul — this one did both.  
In February 2025, **Jaume** and I set out from **Dakar**, Senegal’s lively, ocean-swept capital, with two bicycles and a vague idea: to reach the far southern coast of the country, **Cap Skirring**, by pedal and by patience. What lay between us and the Atlantic was the wild, green heart of **Casamance** — a region split from the rest of Senegal by The Gambia, and tied together by red roads, laughter, and mango trees.

## The Road to Casamance

The first part of the trip wasn’t on two wheels but four — a long, rattling bus ride from Dakar to **Bignona**, where our cycling journey would begin.  
Somewhere between **Kaolack** and the **Gambian border**, the bus coughed, sputtered, and surrendered in the middle of nowhere. The heat rose like a wall, and the road shimmered in the distance. We stepped off with the other passengers, blinking against the sun, until someone pointed to a lone **baobab tree** standing in the fields.  

That tree became our refuge. For three hours, we sat in its shadow — sharing water, fruit, and stories with strangers who, unlike us, seemed utterly unbothered by the delay. Time stretched, laughter carried through the dry air, and when the driver finally managed to bring the engine back to life, the cheer that erupted under that baobab felt like the first victory of the trip.  

By the time we crossed into **The Gambia** and rolled back into Senegal, we already sensed what the road would teach us — that in West Africa, time moves at its own pace, and it’s best to move with it.

## Into the Green

**Bignona** greeted us at dusk. We found two bicycles sturdy enough to survive the southern tracks — not built for speed, but for persistence. The air smelled of dust and roasted peanuts; the kind of scent that clings to your clothes and memory alike. The next morning, we pedaled south into the unknown.

The landscape unfolded slowly. Cashew trees, red earth, and the kind of silence that hums. Children shouted *“Toubab!”* as we passed, waving from the roadside. We rode through fields where women worked barefoot in bright wraps, through villages that seemed to appear out of the forest. By sunset, we reached **Koubalan**, where a small guesthouse offered a bed, a meal, and the kind of peace that comes only after a long ride.

The days began to blur into rhythm.  
Morning rides in soft light. Stops under giant trees. The sound of our tires crunching through laterite dust. By midday, the heat grew heavy and the air smelled of mango and salt. Somewhere between **Koubalan** and **Séléki**, the tarmac gave way to rougher paths, winding between baobabs and small clusters of huts. Locals offered coconuts, smiles, and directions we didn’t always need but always welcomed.

## Between River and Sea

Further south, the world turned blue and green. The scent of water replaced the smell of dust. We reached **Elinkine**, a fishing village near the river’s mouth, where wooden **pirogues** floated lazily in the mangroves. The air was thick with the smell of grilled fish, and the evenings ended with music that seemed to come from everywhere at once.  

From there, we cycled to **Oussouye**, one of Casamance’s cultural hearts. The road was shaded by colossal trees, the kind whose roots look like they’ve been holding the land together for centuries. In Oussouye, we stayed with a local family — eating rice and fish from a single bowl, drinking palm wine under the stars, listening to stories that blurred truth and myth.

One day, we took a detour to **Loudia Ouolof**, cycling through rice paddies and narrow forest paths, passing women balancing baskets on their heads and men paddling canoes through shallow waters. By then, we had stopped checking maps — the road, the people, and the rhythm of pedaling were guide enough.

## Toward the Ocean

The closer we got to the coast, the lighter everything felt. The air grew salty, the wind cooler. On the final morning, leaving **Oussouye** for **Cap Skirring**, we could smell the sea before we saw it. The road twisted through palm groves and open plains, shimmering under the heat.

Just a couple of kilometers before reaching the ocean, **Jaume’s tire punctured**.  
There was no fixing it — not there, not then. So he pushed the bike the rest of the way, sweat running down his face, laughter somewhere between exhaustion and disbelief. When the first glimpse of the **Atlantic** appeared on the horizon, it felt like the end of a pilgrimage.  

We dropped the bikes in the sand and ran straight into the waves. Six days of dust and sweat disappeared in a single dive. The ocean had been waiting for us all along.

## Rest and Reflection

We stayed in **Cap Skirring** for two more days — doing nothing but swimming, eating seafood, and watching the sun dissolve into the ocean. The pace of Casamance seeped into us; hours turned fluid, like the tide itself. Locals came and went, always smiling, always unhurried.  

When it was finally time to leave, we realized that the trip had been less about distance and more about presence — about moving slowly enough to feel every turn of the wheel, every word exchanged, every silence shared. Even Jaume’s flat tire, in the end, felt like part of the rhythm — a reminder that sometimes the road asks you to walk, not ride.
